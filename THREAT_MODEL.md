### Trust Boundaries

```
[User] → [Thirstys Waterfall] → [Operating System] → [Network]
  ✓           ✓                    ⚠️                  ❌
```

- **Trusted**: User, Thirstys Waterfall application code
- **Partially Trusted**: Operating system (depends on platform security)
- **Untrusted**: All network traffic, external services, remote servers

## 3. Threat Actors

### In Scope

#### 1. Network-Based Adversaries
- **Capability Level**: Medium to High
- **Examples**: ISPs, network administrators, man-in-the-middle attackers
- **Objectives**: Monitor traffic, track users, inject content
- **Defenses**: VPN encryption, DNS protection, traffic obfuscation

#### 2. Web-Based Trackers
- **Capability Level**: Low to Medium
- **Examples**: Advertising networks, analytics platforms, fingerprinting services
- **Objectives**: Track user behavior, build profiles, correlate identities
- **Defenses**: Anti-fingerprinting, anti-tracking, cookie blocking

#### 3. Malicious Websites
- **Capability Level**: Medium
- **Examples**: Phishing sites, malware distribution, exploit kits
- **Objectives**: Steal credentials, install malware, exploit vulnerabilities
- **Defenses**: Browser sandbox, URL filtering, firewall rules

#### 4. Local Network Attackers
- **Capability Level**: Low to Medium
- **Examples**: Malicious WiFi hotspots, ARP poisoning, packet sniffing
- **Objectives**: Intercept traffic, redirect connections, inject malware
- **Defenses**: VPN encryption, DNS leak protection, kill switch

### Out of Scope

#### 1. Nation-State Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)
- **Reason**: Requires defense-in-depth beyond this application's scope
- **Mitigation**: Users requiring this level of protection should use dedicated secure operating systems (Tails, Qubes OS)

#### 2. Physical Access Attackers
- **Reason**: Cannot defend against attackers with physical device access
- **Mitigation**: Users should use full-disk encryption, secure boot, and physical security measures

#### 3. Compromised Operating System
- **Reason**: Application-level security cannot defend against OS-level rootkits
- **Mitigation**: Users should maintain OS security updates and use endpoint protection

#### 4. Supply Chain Attacks
- **Reason**: Beyond scope of runtime protection
- **Mitigation**: Use package verification, code signing, and trusted repositories

## 4. Attack Scenarios & Defenses

## 5. Encryption & Key Management

### 5.1 Encryption Architecture

**Layers of Encryption**:

1. **VPN Layer**: All network traffic encrypted end-to-end
   - Protocol: WireGuard (ChaCha20-Poly1305), OpenVPN (AES-256-GCM)
   - Key Exchange: Curve25519
   - Perfect Forward Secrecy: Yes

2. **Storage Layer**: All stored data encrypted at rest
   - Algorithm: AES-256-GCM or Fernet (AES-128-CBC + HMAC-SHA256)
   - Key Derivation: PBKDF2 or scrypt
   - Authentication: HMAC

3. **DNS Layer**: DNS queries encrypted
   - Protocol: DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH)
   - TLS 1.3 with AEAD ciphers

4. **Application Layer**: Sensitive data encrypted in memory
   - Search queries encrypted before processing
   - URLs encrypted before storage
   - Configuration encrypted

### 5.2 Key Management

**Key Hierarchy**:

```
Master Key (User-derived or Hardware-backed)
    │
    ├─→ VPN Session Keys (ephemeral, rotated)
    ├─→ Storage Encryption Key (persistent)
    ├─→ Configuration Encryption Key (persistent)
    └─→ Browser Data Encryption Key (ephemeral)
```

**Key Storage**:
- Master keys: Environment variables, OS keychain, or Hardware Security Module (HSM)
- Session keys: Memory only (never persisted)
- Storage keys: Encrypted with master key
- Key rotation: Automatic rotation of session keys; manual rotation of persistent keys

**Key Derivation**:
- Algorithm: PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 (minimum 100,000 iterations) or scrypt
- Salt: Cryptographically random (32 bytes)
- Output: 256-bit keys

### 5.3 Key Lifecycle

1. **Generation**: Cryptographically secure random generation (256+ bits)
2. **Distribution**: Keys never transmitted; derived locally or from secure vault
3. **Usage**: Keys loaded into memory only when needed
4. **Rotation**: 
   - VPN session keys: Per-connection
   - Storage keys: Every 90 days or on compromise
   - Master key: Yearly or on compromise
5. **Destruction**: Secure memory wiping on key expiration

### 5.4 Key Compromise Response

**If a key is compromised**:
1. Immediately revoke compromised key
2. Generate new key with fresh randomness
3. Re-encrypt all data encrypted with old key
4. Update all systems using the compromised key
5. Conduct security audit to determine compromise scope

## 6. Security Assumptions

### Required Assumptions

1. **Operating System Security**: The underlying OS is not compromised
2. **Cryptographic Primitives**: Standard cryptographic algorithms (AES, ChaCha20) are secure
3. **Random Number Generation**: System CSPRNG provides sufficient entropy
4. **Hardware Integrity**: CPU, memory, and storage are not maliciously tampered
5. **Network Infrastructure**: VPN servers are trustworthy and secure
6. **Time Synchronization**: System clock is approximately accurate (for certificate validation)

### Nice-to-Have (Not Required)

1. **Hardware Security Modules**: TPM, Secure Enclave (used if available)
2. **Secure Boot**: Verified boot chain (additional defense)
3. **Memory Encryption**: RAM encryption (additional protection)

## 7. Out-of-Scope Threats

### 7.1 Explicitly NOT Protected Against

1. **Malware Already on System**: Cannot defend against pre-existing malware or rootkits
2. **Keyloggers**: Cannot prevent keyloggers if OS is compromised
3. **Screen Capture**: Cannot prevent screen recording malware
4. **Clipboard Snooping**: Cannot fully protect clipboard on compromised OS
5. **Side-Channel Attacks**: Timing attacks, power analysis, electromagnetic emissions
6. **Social Engineering**: Phishing, pretexting, physical coercion
7. **Legal/Lawful Intercept**: Court orders, warrants, legal compulsion
8. **Endpoint Exploits**: Vulnerabilities in OS, drivers, or hardware
9. **Global Passive Adversary**: Nation-state level global network monitoring

### 7.2 Partial Protection (Limited)

1. **Browser Exploits**: Depends on underlying browser engine security
2. **Traffic Analysis**: Multi-hop helps but not foolproof against sophisticated adversaries
